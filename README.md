In Windows Command Prompt, you can build by the following command:
g++ -pthread *.cpp -o output.exe
* Please make sure that the g++ compiler is installed on your Windows system and that it's added to your PATH. You can confirm this by typing g++ --version in your command prompt. Note that g++ is typically available on Linux and MacOS systems, but you will need to install it on Windows. The easiest way to do this is through a package manager like MinGW or Cygwin.
